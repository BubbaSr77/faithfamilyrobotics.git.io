                        We were living in Lawton at the time and decided that since I had retired and it had been several years since our last family pictures that it was time to get some new ones done. So we had them done for our sons birthday, late Feb, which of course is not a very warm time of year.

                    We were very fortunate living in Germany, we had quarters off post living on the economy in Hockenheim and our next door neighbors husband George was the general manager for the Hockenheim Rink (the Formula 1 race track) so we got free pit passes discounts and such. There were so many fast cars Austin didn't know what to do. We had a blast though!

                        This was hands down one of the best days/weekends of my career because it was also the beginning of Memorial day weekend in which most of my family was in town for. Spent 4 days on the grill breakfast lunch and supper all off the grill...AWESOME!!!

                        My sister and her family had come to town to visit, so we took them out to see the wildlife refuge and then went up Mt Scott. The view was amazing, looking as if we were on top of the world. Of course the girls wouldn't get right up to the edge.
